once upon a time (ouat) is a multi-player rpg and strategy game based on the warring states era in china.

in order to get this game rolling, i will use the tools that have the lowest barrier in order
to focus on game play, better graphics can come later.


## game play

ouat is set in the era of the 7 kingdoms, the warring states period, qin, chu, wei, qi, yan, zhao, and han kingdoms are battling for control and power, the main goal of the game is to finish the story, but there will be enough freedom in the open world to discover and do things as you like.

Unlike most other RPGs, there are a few key differences:

* ouat is classless, players do not select a class at the beginning of the game (e.g. wizard, thief, cleric, warrior, paladin, etc), all players have general skills, as these skills can be developed over time, different abilities become unlocked.  ouat doesn't have this notion, one can use magic and fight close combat, this doesn't force users to be stuck with a single class.
* materials can be gathered to build new items
* items are invented over time, if one player or npc invents this then everyone benefits
* players can switch jobs over time, jobs will have minimum requirements in terms of skill sets, e.g. foot soldier, government official
* each job will have quests and tasks
* there's a turn based battle, usually to fight off bandits, but additionally there's a larger battle format with more units depending on your rank/title
* player parties can consist of 4 maximum
* each kingdom has its own laws and governance style
* players can change kingdoms based on certain criteria like paying money, experience, certain skill levels, jobs, etc
* jobs are the fastest way to advance skills
* players can build out domeciles
